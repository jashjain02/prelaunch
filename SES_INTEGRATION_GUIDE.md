## Testing

### 1. Run Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_ses_integration.py
```

### 2. Manual Testing
1. Start your FastAPI server
2. Use the test script or make direct API calls
3. Check email delivery in your inbox
4. Verify email content and formatting

### 3. SES Console Monitoring
1. Check SES Console for delivery statistics
2. Monitor bounce and complaint rates
3. Review sending quotas and limits

## Error Handling

### Email Delivery Failures
- Registration still succeeds even if email fails
- Error details logged for debugging
- Response includes `email_sent` status
- Optional `email_error` field for detailed error info

### Common Issues
1. **Unverified Email**: Recipient email not verified in SES
2. **Sandbox Mode**: SES account still in sandbox (limited to verified emails)
3. **Rate Limits**: Exceeding SES sending limits
4. **AWS Credentials**: Incorrect or missing AWS credentials

## Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment variables
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_production_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_production_secret
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
SES_SENDER_EMAIL=alldaysapp@gmail.com
```

### 2. SES Production Access
1. Request production access from AWS
2. Provide business use case details
3. Wait for approval (usually 24-48 hours)

### 3. Domain Verification (Recommended)
1. Verify your domain with SES
2. Set up DKIM authentication
3. Configure SPF and DMARC records

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Logs
- Email sending attempts logged with success/failure
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Message IDs for tracking

### 2. Metrics to Monitor
- Email delivery success rate
- Bounce and complaint rates
- SES quota usage
- API response times

### 3. Maintenance Tasks
- Regular quota monitoring
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Template updates as needed
- Performance optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received
1. Check SES Console for delivery status
2. Verify recipient email is correct
3. Check spam/junk folders
4. Ensure SES account is out of sandbox

### SES Errors
1. Verify AWS credentials
2. Check SES region configuration
3. Ensure email addresses are verified
4. Monitor SES quotas and limits

### API Errors
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test SES connectivity
4. Check rate limiting

## Security Considerations

### 1. AWS Credentials
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Never commit credentials to version control

### 2. Email Security
- Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
- Monitor for email abuse
- Handle bounces and complaints properly

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in emails
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations
- Implement proper data retention policies

## Support

For issues with SES integration:
1. Check AWS SES documentation
2. Review server logs for error details
3. Test with verified email addresses
4. Contact AWS support if needed
